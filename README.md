#What is Selenium
Selenium is a portable software testing suite for web applications. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purpose, but it certainly not limited to just that. Selenium is open source. Selenium is highly flexible. There are many ways you can add functionality to both Selenium test scripts and Selenium’s framework to customize your test automation i.e. We can modify the built-in selenium functions based on our requirement. This is perhaps Selenium’s greatest strength when compared with other automation tools. Selenium is a set of different software tools each with a different approach to supporting test automation. It has 4 components.
